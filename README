Release Notes - 01/29/2002
KNOWN ISSUES

1) receive overrun errors 

Some heavily loaded pc's (especially laptops) exhibit serial receive
overrun errors frequenty. This is due to the operating system not
responding to interrupts in a timely fashion.

A software workaround has been implemented to eliminate this problem.
Since almost all standard UART fifo's are at least 16 bytes deep, the
software workaround limits packet sizes to 16 bytes. Therefore, the
hardware fifo will never overflow so the response time of the
operating system is no longer a problem.

This workaround slows down data rates so it should only be used if
problems occur. This option can be enabled on the commandline or in
the config file.

command line:
	`ez8mon -t 16'

config file (ez8mon.cfg):
	mtu = 16

2) buffer sizes 

There appears to be a limitation on the serial buffer size on most
operating systems. Experimentation has shown this buffer size
limitiation to be 4k on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows XP (other varients of
windows were not tested). Solaris 9 was determined to have a buffer
limitation of 16k.
