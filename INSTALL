Compiling ez8mon
--------------------------------
The Z8 Encore! command line debugger (ez8mon) was origionally written
and compiled under solaris using the gnu gcc compiler. It has also
been compiled under linux using the gnu gcc compiler.

The Z8 Encore! command line debugger has also been ported to windoze
and is typically built using the mingw compiler (a gnu gcc compiler
which produces native windoze executables). 

Mingw and msys can be obtained from
	http://www.mingw.org

A port of the gnu readline library for windoze can be found at
	http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net
